# FLUTTER WORKSHOP**

**Installation (MAC):**

1 - Download [FLUTTER SDK](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_2.0.5-stable.zip)

2 - Extract zip to somewhere you like (eg. development)

```bash
cd ~/development
unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_2.0.5-stable.zip
```
3 - Add flutter to your path (temporarily, but you can also add it into .bash_profile, etc for making it permanent)

```bash
 export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```
4 - Check if some extra things needed (android sdk, xcode etc.):

```bash
 flutter doctor
```

Result of this command will tell you what you need to do to make it runnable on your machine.

If this information is not enough for you, or you are not a mac user, please follow [Flutter Instructions for Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

**Cheatsheet**

*Project Structure*

Let’s first see what’s in the project generated by the Flutter framework:

* **lib/** - just as pub (Dart’s package manager), all the code will be here
* **pubspec.yml** - stores a list of packages that are required to run the application, just like package.json does it. You should remember that in Flutter projects you cannot use pub directly, but instead, you will use the Flutter command: `flutter pub get <package_name>`
* **test/** - I’m sure you know what this is about. Right? You can run them via flutter test
* **ios/** & **android/** - the code specific for each platform, including app icons and settings where you set what permissions you’ll need for your application (like access to location, Bluetooth).

*Good To Know*

Flutter has an intiutive learning curve. For example:

**StatelessWidget** can be used when there is no ui change on any user interaction. Basically: If your widget is stateless, use **StatelessWidget**

**StatefulWidget** can be used when there is changing ui parts on user interaction. Basically: If your widget is stateful, use **StatefulWidget**

**FutureBuilder** lets say you make a request to a service which returns a single response in future (like promise object), you can use **FutureBuilder**

**StreamBuilder** lets say you make a request to a service which returns stream (like rxjs streams) you can use **StreamBuilder**
